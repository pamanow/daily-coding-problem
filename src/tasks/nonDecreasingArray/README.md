## Non-decreasing array

Given an array of integers, write a function to determine,
whether the array could become non-decreasing by modifying at most `1` element.

For example, given the array `[10, 5, 7]`, you should return true,
since we can modify the `10` into a `1` to make the array non-decreasing.
